## PURPOSES

### Section 3.1	General Purpose
The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of California other than the banking business, the trust company business or the practice of a profession permitted to be incorporated by the California Corporations Code.

The specific purpose of the Corporation shall be those stated in the Articles of Incorporation and any amendment thereof. 

## SHAREHOLDING

### Section 4.1	Authorized Number of Shares

### Section 4.2	Preferred Stock A
The shareholders of Preferred Stock A shall have voting rights in the matters of the Corporation. Every shareholder shall have one vote in a matter, irrespective of the number of shares held by them in the Corporation. The Preferred Stock A may also be issued to Employees under Stock Purchase Plan. Upon an employee leaving the Corporation Preferred Stock A becomes Preferred Stock B. If another existing employee or a new employee purchases the shares of the leaving employee, the shares would be converted to Preferred Stock A immediately upon the employee purchasing the shares. 

### Section 4.3 	Preferred Stock B
The Preferred Stock B shall be non-voting and may be redeemable at the discretion of the Initial Director. The Preferred Stock B may be issued to general investors.

### Section 4.4	Payment for Shares

### Section 4.5	Vesting of Shares
Shares shall vest over a four-year period with a one year cliff. Every year 25 percent of shares will vest and 100% vesting would be completed at the end of 4 years. This vesting of shares is applicable to both Preferred Stock A and Preferred Stock B. For every new subscriber a new vesting schedule of 4 year shall commence upon subscription of shares. 

### Section 4.6	Dividend
The Initial Director is the sole Member of the Corporation presently. The Initial Director may increase or decrease the number of shares in a Series. All shareholders shall be entitled to dividends and may opt for Dividend Reinvestment Plan instead of encashment of the dividend, subject to availability of the shares. All shares subscribed for by employees through Dividend Reinvestment Plan would be Preferred Stock A. Dividend shall be calculated in proportion to the shareholding percentage held by each shareholder. Dividend shall be paid annually after deduction of net expenses and keeping sufficient reserve as working capital. From time to time, the Initial Director shall, at his sole discretion, decide on the actual dividend amount each shareholder would be entitled to.

### Section 4.7	Pre-emptive Right & Right of First Refusal
The existing shareholders shall have a pre-emptive right in respect of new offering from the Corporation.

### Section 4.8	Redemption of Shares
Prior to completion of share vesting, if any share is intended to be transferred or if any employee leaves the Corporation, Corporation shall redeem unvested shares at fair market value. The present fair market value of share is 10 times the current revenue of the current year in addition to the original amount invested. The Initial Director may from time to time decide on the computation of fair market value of shares considering the financial and business conditions of the Corporation. The redemption price shall be paid in cash.

### Section 4.9	Transfer of Shares
Any intended transfer of fully vested shares by any existing shareholder will need the approval of the Corporation through its Quorum Vote (defined below in section 9.1 and section 9.9 if there are 2 or more directors). If the intended transferor is unable to find a transferee for shares, Corporation may either on its own or the Initial Director or any of the employees may opt to purchase the shares at fair market value. The transfer of shares shall be recorded in the original share certificate of the transferor. The transfer record on the share certificate shall include the number of shares, the class or series of shares, consideration of transfer and the name of the transferee. 

### Section 4.10	Share Certificates
Each certificate for shares of the Corporation shall set forth therein the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby, the number of shares and the class or series of shares owned by said holder, the par value of the shares represented thereby, and such other statements, as applicable and as prescribed by the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of California. Each such certificate issued shall be signed in the name of the Corporation by the President, by Treasurer and by the Secretary. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile. In case any officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were an officer, at the date of issue. In the event that the Corporation shall issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor, any such certificate for shares shall set forth thereon the statements prescribed by provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of California.
